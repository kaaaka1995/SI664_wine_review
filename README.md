Wine Reviews

## Purpose

This application will use wine reviews data to help users make wine purchase decisions. Users will be able to filter/sort the wines by origin countries, prices, ratings, and taster names, as well as review the winesâ€™ description and other features.

## Data set

 I will be using this Wine Reviews data set from Kaggle:https://www.kaggle.com/zynicide/wine-reviews. Each row of the dataset represents a wine review, the features of which includes the wine title, origin country, province, description of the wine, designation, ratings, price, taster name, winery, variety of the grapes used to make the wine, etc.
